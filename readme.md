# Pantry
## A Meal Planning App

Meal Planning is fun with the Pantry Meal Planning App. Simply pick a theme (or create your own!) and add your favorite recipes. 

This app stores separate weeks that contain meals that contain ingredients to keep your ideas organized. Create, update, edit, or delete meal planning weeks or the meals themselves. Add and delete ingredients for individual meals. You can even customize new meal planning weeks with photos provided--or upload your own!
